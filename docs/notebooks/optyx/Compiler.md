# Example showing how to use the compiler

First start by creating an open graph

```python {.marimo}
# packages added via marimo's package management: networkx !pip install networkx
```

```python {.marimo}
import networkx as nx
```

```python {.marimo}
g = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (1, 2)])
nx.draw(g)
```

```python {.marimo}
from discopy.optyx.compiler import OpenGraph, Measurement

meas = {i: Measurement(0.5 * i, "XY") for i in range(2)}
inputs = [0]
outputs = [2]

og = OpenGraph(g, meas, inputs, outputs)
```

```python {.marimo}
from discopy.optyx.compiler.semm import compile_to_semm
compile_to_semm(og)
```

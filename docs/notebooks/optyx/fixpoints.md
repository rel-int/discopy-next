# Stateful channels: stream and fixed-point semantics

A channel diagram is **stateful** when some of its outputs are fed back into its
inputs one time step later. Such a diagram carries two semantics, and this page
takes them in turn:

1. **feedback loops** — what `feedback` builds and what the memory is;
2. **stream semantics** — `one_step` and `unroll`, the behaviour at each
   finite time;
3. **fixed-point semantics** — `at_time` and the state the loop settles into,
   approximated by `fix` or computed by `eigen_fix` depending on the physics.

```python {.marimo}
import numpy as np

from discopy.symmetric import Equation
from discopy.optyx import photonic
from discopy.optyx.channel import Channel, Discard, bit, qmode
from discopy.optyx.core import diagram

import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="Trial error")  # cotengra probes for optional tree-builders
```

## 1. Feedback loops

`feedback` closes the last `mem` outputs into the last `mem` inputs, delayed by
one step. Here a photon enters at every step and the second output is fed back.

```python {.marimo}
def loop(theta, phi=0.0):
    step = photonic.Create(1) @ qmode >> photonic.MZI(theta, phi)
    return step.feedback(mem=qmode, state=photonic.Create(0))


loop(.25).draw(figsize=(4, 3))
```

```python {.marimo}
print(f"dom={loop(.25).dom}  cod={loop(.25).cod}  mem={loop(.25).mem}")
```

## 2. Stream semantics

A feedback loop carries its boundary as ordinary attributes: the initial
`state` and the final `effect` chosen at `feedback`. The default `state` is
the identity — an open wire — and a channel's default `effect` discards the
memory. `boundary()` reads the pair back across every loop of a diagram, in
the order `unroll` plugs them.

```python {.marimo}
loop_ = loop(.25)
print(f"mem={loop_.mem}  state={loop_.state}  effect={loop_.effect}")
```

The boundary is the **memory wire only**. The inputs and outputs of each tick
stay open — they are the domain and codomain of the stream at that tick.

`one_step()` opens every loop again: one tick, from `dom @ mem` to `cod @ mem`.

```python {.marimo}
step = loop(.25).one_step()
print(f"{step.dom} -> {step.cod}")
step.draw(figsize=(4, 2))
```

`unroll(n)` unrolls `n` times — so `unroll(0)` is one tick — and plugs the
boundaries in, the `state` before the first tick and the `effect` after the
last. That is what the loop becomes:

```python {.marimo}
Equation(loop(.25), loop(.25).unroll(2), symbol=r"$\mapsto$").draw(
    figsize=(11, 4))
```
<!---->
## 3. Fixed-point semantics

Both methods below need a **state** — an empty domain — and every loop needs a
`state`. `at_time(n)` iterates the loop with its output discarded, keeping only
the last, and counts iterations the way `unroll` counts unrollings: `at_time(0)`
is one tick.

```python {.marimo}
loop(.25).at_time(2).draw(figsize=(6, 3))
```

```python {.marimo}
for n in (0, 1, 2, 7):
    measured = loop(.25).at_time(n) >> photonic.NumberResolvingMeasurement(1)
    p = measured.eval().prob_dist()
    print(f"ticks={n + 1}  " + "  ".join(f"p({k[0]})={v:.4f}" for k, v in
                                         sorted(p.items())[:4]))
```

`fix` runs a single tensor-network contraction of an unrolling and returns
the result as an `EvalResult`, so `density_matrix` and `prob_dist` read it
like any other evaluation. The depth comes from `unroll_certificate`, the
stationary boson-sampling bound of Armand Le Douarec, computed from the
loop's one-step optical matrix — loss included, since loss is part of the
diagram. Where the bound does not apply, `certificate_obstruction` names
the reason — a qubit or classical memory, a nested loop, a box with no
Kraus map or no path matrix — and `fix` warns with it before falling back
on `power_fix`, which iterates `at_time` and stops when successive states
agree within the tolerance, warning if `max_steps` arrives first. `fix`
also warns separately when `chi`
truncates the contraction below the photon budget. `eigen_fix` skips the
unrolling altogether and diagonalises the transfer matrix of one step,
following [Biriukov and
Dyakonov (2026)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2602.05566).

```python {.marimo}
measured_1 = loop(0.06) >> photonic.NumberResolvingMeasurement(1)
stationary = measured_1.eigen_fix()
print(type(stationary).__name__)
print('  '.join((f'p({k[0]})={v:.4f}' for k, v in sorted(stationary.prob_dist().items())[:5])))
```

```python {.marimo}
def agreement(left, right):
    return max((abs(left.prob_dist().get(outcome, 0) - probability) for outcome, probability in right.prob_dist().items()))
power = measured_1.fix(max_chi=None, max_steps=8)
print(f'agreement with eigen: {agreement(power, stationary):.2e}')
```

### Which approximation, and when

| method | what it does | truncation `chi` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fix` | one contraction of the unrolling, at the certified depth or at `max_steps` | largest bond dimension kept, `max_chi`: a photon budget past it warns and the bonds past it are truncated down to `max_chi`. `MAX_BOND_DIMENSION = 8` unless overridden; `None` is exact |
| `eigen_fix` | diagonalises the transfer matrix of one step | cutoff search from the photon budget, capped by `max_truncation = MAX_TRUNCATION` |

The physics decides. `eigen_fix` needs the memory cutoff to hold the whole
stationary tail, so it refuses a loop that retains photons — at $\theta=0.25$
the beam splitter is balanced, the tail is long, and no reachable `chi` is
enough. `fix` answers anyway, but says exactly what it could not promise: the
warning above flagged the uncertified depth, and here it also flags the
truncation, since eight steps of this loop already need nine dimensions.

```python {.marimo}
balanced = loop(.25) >> photonic.NumberResolvingMeasurement(1)
try:
    balanced.eigen_fix(max_truncation=16)
except ValueError as error:
    print(f"eigen: {error}")
print("  ".join(f"p({k[0]})={v:.4f}" for k, v in sorted(
    balanced.fix(max_steps=8).prob_dist().items())[:4]))
```

`unroll_certificate` turns the loop itself into a certified depth: it reads
the one-step optical matrix off the loop's Stinespring dilation (`dilate`),
takes the loop-to-loop block $V_{ll}$, and returns the smallest $k$ with
$4K(\bar q)\sum_r \arcsin^2\sigma_r(V_{ll}^k) \leq tol$. A loss channel in
the loop shrinks the singular values of $V_{ll}$ by the amplitude it leaks,
so the same call certifies a shorter depth — loss is never a parameter.

```python {.marimo}
for _gamma in (0.5, 0.9, 0.95):
    _lossy = (loop(0.25).arg >> qmode @ photonic.PhotonLoss(_gamma)).feedback(mem=qmode, state=photonic.Create(0))
    print(f'gamma={_gamma:.2f}  n* = {_lossy.unroll_certificate(1e-06):4d}')
```

`truncation_dimensions` reads the photon budget of every output wire off the
diagram, which is the cutoff `eigen` diagonalises at when no `chi` is given.
It is not uniform: a photon only reaches the wires downstream of where it
enters.

```python {.marimo}
chain = photonic.Create(1) @ photonic.Create(0) >> photonic.BS
for _ in range(3):
    tail = photonic.Id(1) @ photonic.Create(1) >> photonic.BS
    chain = chain >> photonic.Id(len(chain.cod) - 1) @ tail
print(f"budget: {chain.truncation_dimensions()}")
```

### Feedback boson sampling

Let $U$ be a number-preserving unitary on $M+L$ modes. Every step injects a fixed
Fock state on the $M$ external inputs, detects $M$ outputs and feeds $L$ back.

```python {.marimo}
def haar(size, seed):
    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
    z = rng.normal(size=(size, size)) + 1j * rng.normal(size=(size, size))
    q, r = np.linalg.qr(z)
    return q * (np.diag(r) / np.abs(np.diag(r)))


M, L = 2, 1
U = photonic.Gate(haar(M + L, 7), M + L, M + L, "U")
sampler = (photonic.Create(*(1,) * M) @ qmode ** L >> U
           >> photonic.NumberResolvingMeasurement(M) @ qmode ** L
           ).feedback(mem=qmode ** L, state=photonic.Create(0))
sampler.draw(figsize=(5, 3))
```

One step holds both maps: discarding the detected modes gives the **transfer**
channel that updates the loop, $\rho\mapsto\operatorname{Tr}_M[U(\psi\otimes\rho)
U^\dagger]$; discarding the next memory gives the **readout**. `eigen_fix`
diagonalises the transfer map at the stationary memory $\rho_\star$, then reads
out once.

```python {.marimo}
fixed = diagram.Box(r"$\rho_\star$", diagram.Ty(), diagram.Mode(2))
readout = (photonic.Create(*(1,) * M)
           @ Channel(r"$\rho_\star$", fixed, cod=qmode ** L,
                     env=diagram.Mode(1))
           >> U >> photonic.NumberResolvingMeasurement(M) @ Discard(qmode ** L))
Equation(sampler, readout, symbol=r"$\mapsto$").draw(figsize=(11, 3))
```

```python {.marimo}
sampled = sampler.eigen_fix()
for outcome, probability in sorted(
        sampled.prob_dist().items(), key=lambda item: -item[1])[:5]:
    print(f"p{outcome} = {probability:.4f}")
print(f"agreement with eight ticks: "
      f"{agreement(sampler.at_time(7).eval(), sampled):.2e}")
```

A real loop is a fibre, so each round trip transmits a fraction $\gamma$:
`PhotonLoss` puts that in the diagram, where every solver reads it — the
certificate through the dilated one-step matrix, `eigen_fix` through the
transfer channel. Nothing about loss is a solver input.

```python {.marimo}
_gamma = 0.5
_lossy = (photonic.Create(*(1,) * M) @ qmode ** L >> U >> photonic.Id(M) @ photonic.PhotonLoss(_gamma) ** L >> photonic.NumberResolvingMeasurement(M) @ qmode ** L).feedback(mem=qmode ** L, state=photonic.Create(0))
print(f'certified depth at tol=1e-3: {_lossy.unroll_certificate(0.001)}')
certified = _lossy.fix(tol=0.001, max_chi=None)
print(f'agreement with eigen: {agreement(certified, _lossy.eigen_fix()):.2e}')
```

That depth is read off the loop matrix itself, so it accounts for $U$ as
well as $\gamma$. The bound behind it and its proof are in the wiki notebook
*Bounding the unroll length in approximate stationary boson sampling*.

Overview
--------

Combinatorial maps of recurrent channels.

A :class:`CMap` is a combinatorial map: a list of :class:`Box` carrying
channels, together with edges pairing their ports. Its semantics is the
recurrent protocol :meth:`CMap.protocol`, a
:class:`discopy.optyx.channel.Diagram` with a feedback loop on the paired
ports. It has finite stream semantics through :meth:`CMap.unroll` and
stationary semantics through :meth:`CMap.fix`.

This is the Int (geometry of interaction) construction of Joyal, Street
and Verity applied to the feedback category of channels:
:meth:`discopy.optyx.channel.Diagram.feedback` plays the role of a delayed
trace, so the structure is compact closed up to time shifts.

Every port of a box is both read and written at each time step, so a box
:code:`x -> y` carries a channel from :code:`x @ y` to :code:`x @ y` and an
edge carries messages in both directions. A paired port writes into the
memory read by its partner at the next time step; an unpaired port reads
from the domain and writes to the codomain, so :code:`dom == cod` is the
tensor of the unpaired port types.

>>> from discopy.optyx.channel import qubit
>>> from discopy.optyx.qubits import Z, X, Scalar
>>> cnot = Z(1, 2) @ qubit >> qubit @ X(2, 1) @ Scalar(2 ** 0.5)
>>> box = Box("f", qubit, qubit, cnot)
>>> cmap = CMap([box, box], [((0, 1), (1, 0))])
>>> assert cmap.dom == cmap.cod == qubit ** 2
>>> assert cmap.memory == qubit ** 2
>>> assert cmap.unroll(1).dom == cmap.dom ** 2 @ cmap.memory

A box can also carry an internal memory :code:`m` and a prediction
:code:`o`: its channel then goes from :code:`x @ y @ m` to
:code:`x @ y @ m @ o`. The memory is a feedback loop from the box to
itself, never a port of the map; the prediction is written to the
environment at every step but never read, appended to the codomain of the
protocol. A box that copies its memory predicts it without consuming it:

>>> readout = Box("readout", Ty(), Ty(), Z(1, 2),
...     memory=qubit, prediction=qubit)
>>> cmap = CMap([readout], [])
>>> assert cmap.dom == cmap.cod == Ty()
>>> assert cmap.memory == cmap.prediction == qubit
>>> assert cmap.protocol.cod == qubit

Recurrent tensor networks
-------------------------

A :class:`CMap` turns into a tensor network in two orthogonal directions:
*space* — its boxes and edges — and *time* — the unrolled ticks. Each stage
of the construction is a diagram the user can inspect and draw.

The running example is the smallest map that is purely quantum and uses
every kind of wire: three cells connected in a triangle, each carrying an
internal memory and a prediction output. A cell is a single Z spider,
the channel that constrains all its wires to agree in the computational
basis: at every tick it reads its two message ports and its memory,
writes them back and predicts its memory.

>>> from discopy.optyx.channel import qubit
>>> from discopy.optyx.qubits import Z
>>> cell = Box("cell", qubit, qubit, Z(3, 4),
...     memory=qubit, prediction=qubit)
>>> triangle = CMap([cell, cell, cell],
...     [((0, 1), (1, 0)), ((1, 1), (2, 0)), ((2, 1), (0, 0))])
>>> assert triangle.dom == Ty() and triangle.prediction == qubit ** 3
>>> assert triangle.memory == qubit ** 9

**One tick is a channel diagram.** :attr:`CMap.step` composes three
diagrams: :attr:`CMap.read`, a permutation routing :code:`dom @ memory`
onto the inputs of the boxes, then :attr:`CMap.parallel`, the tensor
product of the local channels, then :attr:`CMap.write`, a permutation
routing their outputs to :code:`cod @ prediction @ memory` — each paired
port to the memory read by its partner at the next tick, each internal
memory back to its own box. The permutations carry no data: all the
computation sits in the boxes, as in a premonoidal normal form.

>>> assert triangle.step \\
...     == triangle.read >> triangle.parallel >> triangle.write
>>> triangle.step.draw(figsize=(8, 5), wire_labels=False,
...     path="docs/_static/optyx/interaction_step.png")

.. image:: /_static/optyx/interaction_step.png
    :align: center

**Feedback closes the time loop.** :attr:`CMap.protocol` applies
:meth:`discopy.optyx.channel.Diagram.feedback` to the step, closing
:attr:`CMap.memory` — the paired ports followed by the internal memories —
onto itself with a one-tick delay. The memory is a *delay*, which makes
the protocol the feedback of a monoidal stream (Di Lavore, de Felice and
Román, LICS 2022) rather than a trace: nothing is computed yet, the loop
is syntax.

>>> triangle.protocol.draw(figsize=(8, 5), wire_labels=False,
...     path="docs/_static/optyx/interaction_protocol.png")

.. image:: /_static/optyx/interaction_protocol.png
    :align: center

**Unrolling gives a finite diagram.** :meth:`CMap.unroll` composes
:code:`n_steps + 1` copies of the step, threading the memory from each
tick to the next — below, two ticks of the triangle with the memory left
open; :meth:`CMap.unroll` itself also prepares the initial memory and
discards the final one. The result is an ordinary
:class:`discopy.optyx.channel.Diagram` whose width is the memory cut and whose
depth is the number of ticks.

>>> two_ticks = triangle.step \\
...     >> Diagram.id(triangle.prediction) @ triangle.step
>>> assert two_ticks.cod == triangle.unroll(1).cod @ triangle.memory
>>> two_ticks.draw(figsize=(8, 10), wire_labels=False,
...     path="docs/_static/optyx/interaction_unroll.png")

.. image:: /_static/optyx/interaction_unroll.png
    :align: center

**Doubling gives the tensors.** From here the standard optyx pipeline
applies. :meth:`discopy.optyx.channel.Diagram.double` maps the unrolled channel
diagram to its Kraus map beside the conjugate, and :code:`to_tensor()`
translates it to a :class:`discopy.tensor.Diagram` whose wires carry
dimensions and whose boxes carry arrays — the recurrent tensor network.
DisCoPy contracts it: exactly with :code:`eval`, or through Quimb with
:code:`to_quimb`. The cost is controlled by the number of ticks, the
local dimension of the wires and the width of the memory cut.

>>> import numpy as np
>>> from discopy.optyx.qubits import Ket
>>> unrolled = Ket(1) >> CMap([readout], []).unroll(1)
>>> network = unrolled.double().to_tensor()
>>> expected = (Ket(1) @ Ket(1)).double().to_tensor()
>>> assert np.allclose(network.eval().array.flatten(),
...     expected.eval().array.flatten())

**The fixpoint is computed through contraction.** :meth:`CMap.fix`
closes the time direction the other way: following
:meth:`discopy.optyx.channel.Diagram.fix`, it contracts ever longer unrollings
of the doubled network until the output stops changing — see
:doc:`/notebooks/optyx/fixpoints` for the certificates behind it. For the
triangle, spider fusion makes every memory agree with its neighbours:
started from uniform superpositions, the cells synchronise and the
stationary prediction is the GHZ mixture, perfectly correlated and
uniform.

>>> from discopy.optyx.qubits import H
>>> plus = Ket(0) >> H()
>>> fixed = triangle.fix(
...     initial_state=Diagram.id().tensor(*[plus] * 9),
...     max_steps=4, max_chi=None)
>>> assert np.allclose(fixed.density_matrix.reshape(8, 8),
...     np.diag([.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, .5]))

    A port is a pair :code:`(box, port)` of indices, the second indexing

    and every port belongs to at most one edge. The memory and prediction
    of a box are not ports: they cannot be paired. An edge between two
    ports of the same box is a cup or a cap, so the maps carry the compact
    closed structure of the Int-construction.

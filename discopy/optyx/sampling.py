Overview
--------

Sampling the outputs of closed diagrams with feedback loops, tick after
tick: :meth:`discopy.optyx.channel.Diagram.sample`.

Any such diagram is sampled by its :class:`Unravelling`, a quantum
trajectory: one tick runs :meth:`one_step` box by box on a :class:`CQState`,
a pure state of its quantum wires and definite values of its classical
ones. A box contracts its Kraus map into the state, linear optics through
the :func:`givens` decomposition of its mode matrix and anything else one
box of its Kraus map at a time; its environment and its classical outputs
are measured in the number basis, sampled and collapsed. Measurements,
classical boxes and classical control inside the loops, qubits and
photons with internal states are all sampled this way, at a cost
exponential in the number of quantum wires alive at once.

A passive diagram is sampled through its :class:`Interferometer`, a recurrent
linear-optical network: an interferometer on :math:`L + x` modes whose first
:math:`L` outputs are fed back into its first :math:`L` inputs one tick
later, while a product Fock state :math:`|q\\rangle` is injected into the
other :math:`x` inputs at every tick and the other :math:`x` outputs are
detected by photon-number-resolving detectors. The first :math:`L` modes are
the *loop*, the other :math:`x` are *external*. A loss channel of
transmissivity :math:`\\gamma` acts on every loop mode once per round trip,
and the detectors have efficiency :math:`\\eta`.

With the loop started in the vacuum, the state of the loop conditioned on the
detected history is pure and has a definite photon number: the input is a
product Fock state, the evolution is passive and the photons lost on the way
are sampled rather than traced out. One tick is then:

1. hold the :math:`N + |q|` photons of the loop and the injected photons in
   the modes they occupy,
2. measure the external outputs one at a time along a :class:`Sweep`: bring
   the output to a held mode by a chain of rotations, sample its photon
   number and collapse,
3. map the held modes left at the end onto the loop and sample how many
   photons each loop mode loses, collapsing again,
4. thin the detected pattern binomially, which is exact for inefficient
   detectors since loss before a number measurement is classical.

:meth:`Interferometer.sample` iterates this. With :math:`k` occupied external
inputs, a tick holds one vector of the :math:`(N + |q|)`-photon sector of at
most :math:`L + k + 1` modes, the vacuum inputs never enter and every
measured output leaves, and applies at most :math:`x (L + k)` rotations to
it, plus :math:`L (L - 1) / 2` to land on the loop. So its memory and time
are governed by the loop photon number :math:`N`, whose stationary mean is
:meth:`Interferometer.occupation`. Started from the vacuum, the loop forgets
its initial state at the rate certified by :meth:`Interferometer.burn_in`, so
the window sampled after that many ticks is within the requested total
variation distance of the stationary stream.

Partially distinguishable photons are sampled by colouring them: each
injected photon is in the internal state shared by all photons with
probability :math:`p`, the :attr:`Interferometer.indistinguishability`, and
in one of its own otherwise [RMC+18]_. Photons of different colours never
interfere, so each colour runs its own trajectory and the detectors record
the sum of their patterns. A photon of its own is a single-photon walk,
forgotten once it has left the loop.

A passive diagram, linear optics with losses and discards, is turned into
its :class:`Interferometer` by :meth:`Interferometer.from_diagram`: its
discards and losses are environment outputs, measured and forgotten.

The same trajectory step, with every outcome enumerated rather than sampled,
gives the exact joint distribution of a window in
:meth:`Interferometer.distribution`. Evolving a pure state through the part of
the circuit a measurement depends on, then measuring and collapsing, is the
progressive simulation of Novák et al. [NRM+25]_ for loop-based time-bin
interferometers; here the cut is the loop itself, whatever the
interferometer, and within a tick each external output is measured as soon
as the held modes reach it.

Example
-------

A delay line swaps the loop with the external mode, so it detects at every
tick the photon injected one tick earlier:

>>> delay = Interferometer([[0, 1], [1, 0]], loop=1, inputs=(1, ))
>>> delay.sample(ticks=3, seed=0)
[(0,), (1,), (1,)]
>>> delay.burn_in(1e-9)
1
>>> delay.occupation()
1.0

    The quantum trajectories of a closed :class:`discopy.optyx.channel.Diagram`
    with feedback loops, whatever it holds: optical modes, qubits,
    measurements, classical boxes and classically controlled boxes.

    A tick runs :meth:`one_step` layer by layer on a :class:`CQState`. A box
    contracts its Kraus map into the state, its classical inputs selecting
    the slice of their values, and its environment and classical outputs
    are measured in the number basis, sampled and collapsed: the Kraus
    operators :math:`(\\langle e| \\otimes 1) K` unravel the channel
    :math:`\\rho \\mapsto \\mathrm{tr}_E(K \\rho K^\\dagger)`. A classical box
    samples its outputs from its inputs. The outputs of the diagram are
    then measured and recorded, those of the memory carried to the next
    tick. The loops start in the state of :meth:`boundary`, run on the
    same way.

    Photons with internal states are sampled on the diagram inflated to
    as many :func:`levels`, every optical mode becoming as many modes whose
    counts the detectors add up.

    Each optical mode holds at most `cap` photons, a qubit is a two-level
    wire, so that every tick is a fixed sequence of contractions on fixed
    shapes; a trajectory past the cap raises, and so does a box that is not
    trace preserving, i.e. a postselection. The cost of a tick is
    exponential in the number of quantum wires alive at once: passive
    diagrams are better sampled by their :class:`Interferometer`.
